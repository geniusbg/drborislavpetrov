# Architectural Decision: Task Management App Architecture

**Date:** 2025-06-11  
**Decision by:** Søren Andersen, Marcus Jensen, Elena Sørensen  
**Status:** Approved  
**Client:** Incredible Solutions A/S

## Context
Incredible Solutions needs a simple task management application to replace their Excel-based task tracking. The application must support 25 users and be easy to use with minimal technical complexity.

## Decision
Selected technology stack and architecture:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent UI development
- **State Management:** React Context for simple global state

### Backend Architecture  
- **API:** Next.js API routes (full-stack approach)
- **Database:** SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** Simple JWT-based authentication

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
users: id, email, name, created_at, updated_at

-- Tasks table  
tasks: id, title, description, due_date, completed, 
       created_by, created_at, updated_at
```

### Deployment
- **Hosting:** Simple cloud hosting (Vercel or similar)
- **Environment:** Single production setup

## Rationale

### Technology Choices
- **Next.js 15:** Full-stack framework reduces complexity, excellent TypeScript support
- **SQLite + Drizzle:** Simple deployment, type-safe queries, sufficient for 25 users
- **Tailwind CSS:** Matches team expertise, rapid UI development, consistent design system
- **JWT Authentication:** Simple, stateless authentication

### Architecture Benefits
- **Single codebase:** Reduces maintenance overhead
- **Type safety:** TypeScript throughout stack reduces runtime errors
- **Simple deployment:** Easy to host and maintain
- **Minimal complexity:** Client has no IT staff, simplicity is key

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with familiar technology stack
- Type safety reduces bugs and improves developer experience
- Simple deployment and maintenance
- Clear migration path for future scaling

### Negative
- SQLite limits concurrent users (acceptable for 25 users)
- Simple feature set (matches client requirements)
- Limited to JavaScript ecosystem (team expertise aligns)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **SQLite scaling:** Monitor performance, acceptable for current scale
- **Security:** Basic security practices, HTTPS deployment
- **Data backup:** Regular backups included with hosting platform

## Implementation Plan
1. **June 2025:** Core task management functionality
2. **July 2025:** User authentication and final deployment

## Review Schedule
- **Performance review:** After 6 months of usage
- **Feature review:** Based on client feedback after launch
