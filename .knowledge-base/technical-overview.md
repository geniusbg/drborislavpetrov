# Technical Overview

## Architecture
Modern web application built with Next.js and TypeScript, designed for simplicity and maintainability.

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server-side rendering
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM for simplicity

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/ui**: Component library for consistent UI

#### Backend & Database
- **Next.js API Routes**: Server-side logic
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database (production will use PostgreSQL)

#### Development
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Git**: Version control with feature branch workflow

### Database Schema
```sql
Users
- id, email, name, password_hash, role, created_at

Tasks
- id, title, description, status, priority, assigned_to, created_by, due_date, created_at, updated_at

Projects (future enhancement)
- id, name, description, created_by, created_at
```

### Key Features Implementation
- **Task Management**: CRUD operations with real-time updates
- **User Dashboard**: Personal task overview and filtering
- **Admin Interface**: User management and system overview

### Security Considerations
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- Environment variable protection
- HTTPS-only in production

### Performance Optimizations
- Server-side rendering for fast initial loads
- Client-side caching for subsequent navigations
- Optimized database queries via Prisma
- Image optimization via Next.js
