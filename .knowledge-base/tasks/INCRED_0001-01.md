# Task INCRED_0001-01: Demo App Development

## Objectives
- Build task management demo app for tomorrow's presentation
- Demonstrate Virtual Team consultation workflow
- Showcase professional development process with AI collaboration

## Requirements
**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- SQLite + Drizzle ORM, React Context/Zustand
- Clean, professional UI representing work quality

**Core Features (Pre-Auth):**
- Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Task display: title, description, due date, status, categories
- Basic filtering (All, Complete, Incomplete)
- 5-10 sample tasks for realistic demo

**Demo Story Arc:**
1. Show basic task app (anyone sees all tasks)
2. Identify problem: "Need user authentication" 
3. Virtual team consultation workflow
4. Implement auth based on team input
5. Document architectural decision

## Technical Considerations
- Focus on consultation process over complex features
- Authentication will be added during demo (JWT vs sessions)
- Sample data should make demo feel realistic
- File structure: app/, components/, lib/, drizzle/

## Timeline
**URGENT: Presentation tomorrow**

## Next Steps
- Consult virtual team for architecture decisions
- Build core app structure and components
- Add sample data and professional styling
